A doctor appointment website project faces several key challenges. First, ensuring secure login and role-based access for patients, doctors, and admins is crucial. Preventing double bookings requires accurate time-slot management. Real-time notifications for confirmations or cancellations can be difficult without tools like WebSockets. Managing doctors' schedules dynamically and protecting sensitive patient data also pose challenges, requiring strong backend logic and encryption. Additionally, implementing a smooth search/filter system for doctors and building a responsive design for all devices are essential for a good user experience. Scalability must also be considered as user data and traffic grow.
